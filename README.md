# BuddyUpApp
This app is based on my AWS free tier Bitnami Parser Server instance, which has to be in running state.
Since the Server has limited free usage only, I close it when I'm not working. You can create your own server through AWS and change the details in 'StarterApplication.java'
and then use the app.
